### Vite
Vite provides developers with a faster and more streamlined development experience, thanks to its faster build times and on-demand compilation. This means it only compiles what's actually used in the project, reducing the size and complexity of the resulting code. This makes it ideal for small and large projects alike, as it helps keep the codebase clean, maintainable, and fast.
